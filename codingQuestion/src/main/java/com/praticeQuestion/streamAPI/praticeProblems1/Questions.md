1.  **Filter and Sum:** Write a Java program that uses streams to filter a list of integers and then calculate the sum of the filtered numbers. For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], filter out even numbers and calculate their sum.

2.  **Map and Collect:** Create a program that takes a list of strings, converts each string to uppercase using streams, and collects the results into a new list.

3.  **Distinct Elements:** Write a Java program that uses streams to find and print the distinct elements from a list of integers. For example, given the list [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5], the program should print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

4.  **Find Maximum Element:** Create a program that finds the maximum element from a list of integers using streams.

5.  **Grouping by Length:** Given a list of strings, group the strings by their length using streams. Return a Map where the keys are the lengths, and the values are lists of strings with that length.

6.  **FlatMap and Distinct:** Write a program that takes a list of lists of integers and uses streams to flatten it into a single list of distinct integers. For example, if the input is [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]], the output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

7.  **Average of List:** Calculate the average of a list of doubles using streams.

8.  **Filter and Join:** Given a list of strings, filter out the strings that contain the letter 'a' and join the remaining strings into a single comma-separated string using streams.

9.  **Parallel Stream Processing:** Modify one of the previous programs to use parallel streams and compare the performance with the sequential version.

10.  **Custom Object Filtering:** If you have a list of custom objects (e.g., Person objects with attributes like name, age, etc.), use streams to filter out people above a certain age or with a specific attribute.
